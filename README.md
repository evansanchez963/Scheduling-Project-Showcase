# Scheduling-Project-Showcase
This is a showcase of the scheduling project I worked on for my senior capstone project. 

## Disclaimer
For privacy reasons, I cannot show the code. However, I will give a brief overview of how it works below.

## About this Project
This application is built with JavaScript and Node.js and uses the Excel.js and Moment.js libraries for styling. It is used to help the computer science department schedule their courses at the beginning of a semester, and it has been adapted to work with data from the math department too. It runs on the command line, and it outputs a styled Excel sheet given an input Excel sheet that contains course data for a specific semester.
